# Consuming Artifacts

## Summary

Analysing a build to determine if it's safe is more work than simply not allowing unverified builds.

## Motivation

Software supply-chain is an intensely large landscape.
From the consumer-of-artifacts end of the stick, making consumption safe is key.
It's always easier to have an unbreakable policy than to verify that something followed a potentially unenforceable policy, with regards to consumption.

## Design

Part of supply-chain is ephemeral build environments.

A repository proxy could be instilled with the policy that must be followed.
By using SSC data (via Sigstore, In-Toto, elsewhere), the proxy could allow or deny access to artifacts.
Additionally, reports or actionable insights could be produced on a per-build basis in order to assess and limit risk exposure.

A given proxy *must* support multiple languages and ecosystems _simultaneously_.

Ignoring the larger problem of verifying an entire build of an entire OS distribution, even from an application-developer perspective, multiple languages and upstream repositories could be involved for any given build.

The proxy *should not* be considered a repository for long-term storage. Per the _ephemeral build environments_ axiom, the proxy should exist only long enough to apply artifact-consumption policies in real-time while building the end artifact under consideration.

Local caching *may* be used for efficiency purposes, during the course of a simple build, as long as no ambiguities can occur regarding artifacts.
