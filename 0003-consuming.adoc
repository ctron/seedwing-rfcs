# Consuming Artifacts

## Summary

Analysing a build to determine if it's safe is more work than simply not allowing unverified builds.

## Motivation

Software supply-chain is an intensely large landscape.
From the consumer-of-artifacts end of the stick, making consumption safe is key.
It's always easier to have an unbreakable policy than to verify that something followed a potentially unenforceable policy, with regards to consumption.

## Design

Part of supply-chain is ephemeral build environments.

A repository proxy could be instilled with the policy that must be followed.
By using SSC data (via Sigstore, In-Toto, elsewhere), the proxy could allow or deny access to artifacts.
Additionally, reports or actionable insights could be produced on a per-build basis in order to assess and limit risk exposure.

A given proxy *must* support multiple languages and ecosystems _simultaneously_.

Ignoring the larger problem of verifying an entire build of an entire OS distribution, even from an application-developer perspective, multiple languages and upstream repositories could be involved for any given build.

The proxy *should not* be considered a repository for long-term storage. Per the _ephemeral build environments_ axiom, the proxy should exist only long enough to apply artifact-consumption policies in real-time while building the end artifact under consideration.

Local caching *may* be used for efficiency purposes, during the course of a simple build, as long as no ambiguities can occur regarding artifacts.

## Examples

### _allow all_

A proxy running with an _allow all_ policy is effectively a transparent pass-through proxy.
The exception is that awareness of inbound artifact can be recorded, analysed and reported upon.

A proxy running _allow all_ mode would be useful during active development when "getting code to work" is a higher priority than "supply-chain safety".

The resulting reports can assist in helping a developer to select different versions or different dependencies in order to reduce risk exposure prior to release.

### _allow $level_

Depending on the development model used by a given team or organization or the anticipated end-use of the resulting build, it may be useful, to provide _some_ restriction on inbound artifacts.

For instance, while all used dependencies may not be "fully approved", the proxy may at least restrict dependencies to those with no currently known CVEs.

An organization may use this mode while preparing for release builds to occur.

### _allow safe_

The degenerate case of _allow $level_ which is contrary to _allow_all_ is the most strict level, which requires full traceability between the artifact under build and *all* relevant dependencies and their own build process and source origin.
