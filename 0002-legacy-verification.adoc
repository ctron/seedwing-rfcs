# Legacy Verification

## Summary

A ton of artifacts have been built.
Some could even be many years old.
Can we verify them?
Can we attest anything about them?

## Motivation

The software supply chain is not a greenfields effort.
Anything built today will inevitably rely on something previously built in the days prior.
We need to be able to consider how to possibly verify, to some level or another, extant legacy artifacts.

## Analysis

### Source distributed

For ecosystems whose artifacts are source distributions, there exists at least two methods of verification.

1. Verifying the integrity of the source package, _as distributed_, without concern of provenance to any underlying source-control system.
2. Determining the actual provenance of of the source-distributed package to the source-control system with development history.

The first is "easy" to perform, for some value of "easy".
The package may be viewed as a completely standalone package of code to be analyzed at a point-in-time.
A skilled human may inspect and review the underlying source, cross-referencing any candidate CVEs or patches, and decide if a legacy artifact is "okayish".

The second is slightly less easy.
A human or automated system may attempt to correlate a versioned package, as distributed, to some underlying revision-control system, discovering (through manual or mechanical means) which commit, in which repository, exactly matches the artifact as distributed.

This may not always be "simple", as many projects have failed to tag the revision-control system, have applied tags poorly, or the RCS may be completely unfindable.

### Binary distributed

Artifacts that are distributed as binary items is significantly more difficult to validate.

First, just as with the source-distributed artifacts above, an attempt must be made to discover the underlying source.
If potential source commits have been located, reproducing the binary may or may not be possible for a variety of reasons:

1. Build environment may be complex or undocumented.
2. Build environment may rely on other unverified components.
3. As above, tags or commits may have been poor applied, and the assumed source of origin may be incorrect.
4. Binary compilation tools may not reliably produce reproducible builds.

Assuming all of the above is avoided, replicating the build and comparing the known build to the extant artifact should, in theory, then be straightforward.

If, as with Java, there can be different binaries produced depending on the version, platform or vendor of toolchain used to build, or even the time-of-day (for artifacts which in any way include a build timestamp), simplistic comparison becomes significantly harder.
