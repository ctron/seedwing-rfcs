# Decentralized & Distributed

Software Supply-Chain Security is not solvable in a single trusted ball of mud.
Supporting fully-secure SSCS should *not* require a single trusted mechanism to ensure end-to-end trust.

## Summary

Software is contructed and used in a multitude of ways.
It is pert near impossible for any single product or solution to provide trusted mechanism for all builders and consumers of software.
Just as with physical supply-chain, every organization (and sub-organization within) may have its own requirements, capabilities, processes and methods.
Likewise, these organizations may or may not cooperate to align each output with the next expected input.
SSCS *must* support a multitude of disjoint operations from a multitude of disjoint participants while still delivering trustable content.

Just as software is encouraged to be loosely-coupled, with separation-of-concerns composed into larger functional pieces, all of the validation of the software-supply-chain should also compose into a trust level.
