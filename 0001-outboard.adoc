# Outboard

## Summary

Where possible, software supply-chain (SSC) data should be possible to associate, outboard, to artifact(s) under discussion.

## Motivation

There exists a lot of artifacts, previously built, in the wild.
The time has passed for inbuing these artifacts with additional SSC data, metadata or manifests.

There also exists a significant number of artifact-producing communities, which may or may not ever fully adopt SSC technologies.
If they do adopt SSC technologies, specifications or formats, they may adopt *different* variants.

Organizations such as Red Hat thrive by providing _assurances_ to their customers regarding the artifacts they provide, support, or otherwise sanction.
Other organizations providing the same services may or may not agree on the validity/assessment of given artifacts.
Other organizations may make claims about artifacts they originate, which Red Hat (or still yet others) disagree with or otherwise do not initially trust.

By providing, in *all cases* the ability to associate SSC data detached from the artifacts being asserted, multiple organizations can all make assertions and attestations they are willing to stand behind with their own reputation.
With outboard data, there is no distinct advantage to being the originator or the first attestor of a given artifact.
Consumers can decide _which_ attestor's reputation and assurances matter to them.
