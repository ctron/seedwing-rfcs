# Licenses

## Summary

The license under which a given artifact is provided is not always immediately obvious, especially to policy-enforcing entities.

By using signatures from a constellation of attestors, licensing can be made actionable.

## Motivation

By using these signatures with OPA policies, license compatibility can be semantically defined.

## Details

Some organizations, by definition, apply various licenses to all artifacts available through them.
For instance, everything from the Apache Software Foundation is licensed under some variant of the Apache License.
The Apache License has two graphs of consumption:

1. The licenses allowed by be consume _by_ an AL project.
2. The licenses allowed to consume the AL project.

OPA policies can be defined to describe the asymetry in license compatibility.
Attestors can manually or mechanically verify and attest to license applications to artifacts.
